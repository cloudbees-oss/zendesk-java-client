h3. Migration to Codeship

It is a temporal file to track the migration steps od moving this project from Jenkins D@C to Codeship Basic project

Notes: Codeship currently doesâ€™t trigger builds for PRs from forked repositories. We have created a RFE for that [PROD-1600](https://cloudbees.atlassian.net/browse/PROD-1600)
